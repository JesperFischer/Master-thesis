	abstract = {Behavioral researchers tend to study behavior in highly controlled laboratory settings to minimize the effects of potential confounders. Yet, while doing so, the artificial setup itself might unintentionally introduce noise or confounders, such as boredom. In this perspective, we draw upon theoretical and empirical evidence to make the case that (a) some experimental setups are likely to induce boredom in participants, (b) the degree of boredom induced might differ between individuals as a function of differences in trait boredom, (c) boredom can impair participants’ attention, can make study participation more effortful, and can increase the urge to do something else (i.e., to disengage from the study). Most importantly, we argue that some participants might adjust their behavior because they are bored. Considering boredom’s potential for adding noise to data, or for being an unwanted confound, we discuss a set of recommendations on how to control for and deal with the occurrence and effects of boredom in behavioral science research.},

	abstract = {Reaction time testing is widely used in computerized cognitive assessments, and clinical studies have repeatedly shown it to be a sensitive indicator of cognitive function. Typically, the reaction time test is administered by presenting a subject with a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the individual to respond (via keypad or computer mouse) as quickly as possible. The individual’s reaction time is calculated as the interval between presentation of the stimulus and the time recorded from the mechanical response. However, there are many inherent latencies and variabilities that may be introduced to the measure by both hardware (computer monitor and mouse) and software (operating system). Because of these delays, we hypothesized that a comparison of hardware protocols (excluding human response) would demonstrate significant differences in the resulting reaction time measures. To simulate the delays of various components of the common systems used to obtain reaction time, we conducted a simple experiment in which either a visual or tactile stimulus evoked a movement from a mechanical transducer to respond to a computer peripheral or a dedicated response device. In the first condition, a simulated visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. The stimulus was detected by a dedicated light sensor, and a linear actuator delivered the mechanical response via computer mouse. The second test condition employed a mobile device as the medium for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device’s touchscreen. The third and fourth test conditions simulated tactile reaction time tests in which the stimulus was generated by a dedicated hardware device. The third condition simulated a tactile stimulus, which was detected by a mechanical switch, and again a hardware device delivered the response via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile stimulus, but the response was delivered by a dedicated hardware device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and stimulus response. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from a visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.},

The SMART is a USB device realized with a Cypress Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC) mixed-signal array programmable microcontroller. A brief overview of the hardware and firmware of the PSoC is provided, together with the results of three experiments. In Experiment 1, we investigated the timing accuracy of the SMART in measuring reaction time (RT) under different conditions of operating systems (OSs; Windows XP or Vista) and monitor displays (a CRT or an LCD). The results indicated that the timing error in measuring RT by the SMART was less than 2 msec, on average, under all combinations of OS and display and that the SMART was tolerant to jitter and noise. In Experiment 2, we tested the SMART with 8 participants. The results indicated that there was no significant difference among RTs obtained with the SMART under the different conditions of OS and display. In Experiment 3, we used Microsoft (MS) PowerPoint to present visual stimuli on the display. We found no significant difference in RTs obtained using MS DirectX technology versus using the PowerPoint file with the SMART. We are certain that the SMART is a simple and practical solution for measuring RTs accurately. Although there are some restrictions in using the SMART with RT paradigms, the SMART is capable of providing both researchers and health professionals working in clinical settings with new ways of using RT paradigms in their work.},

This study aimed to identify potential delays in time measurement with the use of computers in RT research through the analysis of scientific production from articles published in the electronic database Web of Science (R) powered by Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge(SM). The publications analyzed delays generated in the use of a CRT/LCD monitor, keyboard or mouse, finding significant differences. DOS, Mac, Linux and Windows Operating systems were investigated. The results of the studies reported delays ranging from 0.0006 to 80ms in the keyboards evaluated; 8 to 52ms in 'mice'; and 0.0005 to 68ms in the monitors. Although computers are widely used for RT measurements, the reliability of time measurement is directly related to the technical characteristics of the accessories used and the configuration of the operating system. We conclude that studies with computer-measured RT tests must be carefully analyzed, since the effectiveness of the time measurements is directly related to the type and quality of the equipment used, as well as the operating systems and software developed. A discussion regarding the scientific literature on the problem of using computers to perform tests involving time measurement, possible errors involving the use of software and hardware, as well as the solutions that have already been found to decrease their impact on time measurement is important for Psychology of Sport and Exercise, because it will enable us to suggest the care needed to obtain a reliable measurement.},

	abstract = {Background
The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is a widely used measure of perceived stress that has been validated in various populations, yet with inconsistent results on its factor structure. The present study examines the reliability and validity of the PSS-10 in a population not previously examined: Chinese family caregivers of persons with schizophrenia, with a focus on factor analysis.

Methods
A sample of 449 family caregivers of persons with schizophrenia was recruited for psychometric testing of the scale. The factor structure of PSS-10 was tested by randomly dividing the sample into two groups for both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale was further tested for internal consistency, test–retest reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity and concurrent validity.

Results
EFA extracted two factors: perceived helplessness with six negative phrasing items and perceived efficacy with four positive phrasing items. CFA confirmed the structure of two factors with satisfactory model fit indices. Convergent validity was supported by high standard regression weight (0.78–0.92), average variance extracted (AVE=0.79–0.81) and composite reliability (0.88–0.94), while discriminant validity was confirmed by higher AVE estimates than the squared interconstruct correlations. The PSS-10 showed good internal consistency and test–retest reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.91, respectively. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by its significant positive correlations with stigma, depression and anxiety, as well as significant negative correlations with social support, family functioning and positive caregiving experiences.

Conclusion
The two-factor PSS-10 has good psychometric characteristics assessing the perceived stress of family caregivers of people with schizophrenia. The findings indicate that the PSS-10 can be used to measure perceived stress in future research and practice among caregivers of people with schizophrenia, and potentially, other caregiving samples.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Patients undergoing treatment (N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50\%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution. The GAD-7 has excellent internal consistency, and the one-factor structure in a heterogeneous clinical population was supported.},

Because skips are more common, the total monetary value of aggregated categories such as assets or expenditures declines as the survey goes on, and this effect is sizeable for some categories: for example, an extra hour of survey time lowers food expenditures by 25\%. We find similar effect sizes within phone surveys in which respondents were already familiar with questions, suggesting that cognitive burden may be a key driver of survey fatigue.},

However, these procedures rely on an increasing number of parameters that are unknown at the planning stage of the clinical trial, so the study design requires particular care. This review is dedicated to adaptive enrichment studies with a focus on design aspects. While many papers deal with methods for the analysis, the sample size determination and the optimal allocation problem have been overlooked.

Simultaneously, mean reaction times (RT) decrease, which collectively define the chronometric function. However, RTs are traditionally ignored when estimating psychophysical parameters, even though they may provide additional Shannon information. Here, we extend Palmer et al's ({\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"{\textgreater}2005{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}) proportional-rate diffusion model (PRD) by: (a) fitting individual RTs to an inverse Gaussian distribution, (b) including lapse rate, (c) point-of-subjective-equality (PSE) parameters, and, (d) using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) design based on the proportion of times a variable comparison stimulus is chosen. Maximum likelihood estimates of mean RT values (from fitted inverse Gaussians) and binary responses were fitted both separately and in combination to this extended PRD (EPRD) model, to obtain psychophysical parameter values. Values estimated from binary responses alone (i.e., the psychometric function) were found to be similar to those estimated from RTs alone (i.e., the chronometric function), which provides support for the underlying diffusion model. The EPRD model was then used to estimate the mutual information between binary responses and stimulus strength, and between RTs and stimulus strength. These provide conservative bounds for the average amount of Shannon information the observer gains about stimulus strength on each trial. For the human experiment reported here, the observer gains between 2.68 and 3.55 bits/trial. These bounds are monotonically related to a new measure, the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Shannon increment{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, which is the expected value of the smallest change in stimulus strength detectable by an observer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Advances in Bayesian statistics and machine learning offer algorithm-based ways to identify good experimental designs. Adaptive design optimization (ADO; Cavagnaro, Myung, Pitt, \& Kujala, 2010; Myung, Cavagnaro, \& Pitt, 2013) is one such method. It works by maximizing the informativeness and efficiency of data collection, thereby improving inference. ADO is a general-purpose method for conducting adaptive experiments on the fly and can lead to rapid accumulation of information about the phenomenon of interest with the fewest number of trials. The nontrivial technical skills required to use ADO have been a barrier to its wider adoption. To increase its accessibility to experimentalists at large, we introduce an open-source Python package, ADOpy, that implements ADO for optimizing experimental design. The package, available on GitHub, is written using high-level modular-based commands such that users do not have to understand the computational details of the ADO algorithm. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial introduction to ADOpy and ADO itself, and then illustrate its use in three walk-through examples: psychometric function estimation, delay discounting, and risky choice. Simulation data are also provided to demonstrate how ADO designs compare with other designs (random, staircase).},

Such methods typically target only one or two ("threshold" and "slope") of the PF's four parameters while assuming fixed values for the "nuisance" parameters ("guess rate" and "lapse rate"). Here I propose the "psi-marginal" adaptive method, which can target nuisance parameters but only when this is the most optimal manner in which to reduce uncertainty in the value of the parameters of primary interest. The method is based on Kontsevich and Tyler's (1999) psi-method. However, in the proposed method a posterior distribution defined across all parameters of unknown value is maintained. Each of the parameters is specified either as a parameter of primary interest whose estimation should be optimized or as a nuisance parameter whose estimation should be subservient to the estimation of the parameters of primary interest. Critically, selection of stimulus intensities is based on the expected information gain in the marginal posterior distribution defined across the parameters of interest only. The appeal of this method is that it will target nuisance parameters adaptively and only when doing so maximizes the expected information gain regarding the values of the parameters of interest. Simulations indicate that treating the lapse rate as a nuisance parameter in the psi-marginal method results in smaller bias and higher precision in threshold and slope estimates compared to the original psi method.

	abstract = {The effects of stress are frequently studied, yet its proximal causes remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that subjective estimates of uncertainty predict the dynamics of subjective and physiological stress responses. Subjects learned a probabilistic mapping between visual stimuli and electric shocks. Salivary cortisol confirmed that our stressor elicited changes in endocrine activity. Using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we quantified the relationship between the different forms of subjective task uncertainty and acute stress responses. Subjective stress, pupil diameter and skin conductance all tracked the evolution of irreducible uncertainty. We observed a coupling between emotional and somatic state, with subjective and physiological tuning to uncertainty tightly correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty tuning of subjective and physiological stress predicted individual task performance, consistent with an adaptive role for stress in learning under uncertain threat. Our finding that stress responses are tuned to environmental uncertainty provides new insight into their generation and likely adaptive function.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how perceived stress may affect electroencephalographical (EEG) activity in a stress paradigm in a sample of 76 healthy participants. EEG activity was analyzed using multilevel modeling, allowing estimation of nested effects (EEG time segments within subjects). The stress paradigm consisted of a 3-minute pre-stimulus stress period and a 2-minute post-stimulus phase. At t=3 minutes, a single electrical stimulus was delivered. Participants were unaware of the precise moment of stimulus delivery and its intensity level. In the EEG time course of alpha activity, a stronger increase was observed during the post-stimulus period as compared to the pre-stimulus period. An opposite time course effect was apparent for gamma activity. Both effects were in line with a priori expectations and support the validity of this experimental EEG-stress paradigm. Secondly, we investigated whether interaction effects of stress and coping, as measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 questionnaire (PSS-10), could be demonstrated. A higher perceived stress score was accompanied by a greater increase in delta- and theta-activity during the post-stimulus phase, compared to low scores. In contrast, low coping capacity was associated with a stronger decrease in slow beta, fast beta and gamma activity during the post-stimulus phase. The results of the present article may be interpreted as proof-of-principle that EEG stress-related activity depends on the level of subjectively reported perceived stress. The inclusion of psychosocial variables measuring coping styles as well as stress-related personality aspects permits further examination of the interconnection between mind and body and may inform on the process of transformation from acute to chronic stress.},

Importantly, individuals display marked variation in how they perceive and cope with stressful events, and such differences are strongly linked to risk for developing psychiatric symptoms following stress exposure. However, many questions remain regarding the neural architecture that underlies inter-subject variability in perceptions of stressors. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a monetary incentive delay paradigm, we examined the effects of self-reported perceived stress levels on neural activity during reward anticipation and feedback in a sample of healthy individuals. We found that subjects reporting more uncontrollable and overwhelming stressors displayed blunted neural responses in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following feedback related to monetary gains as well monetary losses. This is consistent with preclinical models that implicate the mPFC as a key site of vulnerability to the noxious effects of uncontrollable stressors. Our data help translate these findings to humans, and elucidate some of the neural mechanisms that may underlie stress-linked risk for developing reward-related psychiatric symptoms.},

Consistent with past research, the findings revealed an increase in depression level as negative life change scores increased. Of special importance, however, was the finding that global level of stress significantly moderated the relationship between depression and negative life events. For those low on perceived stress, negative life changes had only a minimal impact on depression level. In contrast, for those high on perceived stress, the relationship was more pronounced.

Developmental studies suggested that adolescents are more vulnerable and sensitive to the effect of stress due to their developing brains, especially in areas related to stress perception and processing. This voxel-based morphometry study examined the association between various neurobiological markers and the level of perceived stress experienced by adolescents (n = 26) and middle-aged adults (n = 26). Our findings indicated that differences existed in the relationships between perceived stress and the structural volume of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) extending to the insula and amygdala. Specifically, the levels of perceived stress and the grey matter volume of the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula, and the amygdala were positively related in adolescents but negatively related for adults. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and cortisol levels was observed in adults, whereas the relationship between perceived stress and cortisol levels was not significant for adolescents. Perceived stress measurement may be better than cortisol levels in terms of reflecting the emotional states of adolescents. In sum, the relationships between perceived stress and neurobiological markers were different between adolescents and middle-aged adults and thus appeared to be age dependent.},

	shorttitle = {Beyond linear regression},
	abstract = {Many cognitive neuroscience studies use large feature sets to predict and interpret brain activity patterns. Feature sets take many forms, from human stimulus annotations to representations in deep neural networks. Of crucial importance in all these studies is the mapping model, which defines the space of possible relationships between features and neural data. Until recently, most encoding and decoding studies have used linear mapping models. Increasing availability of large datasets and computing resources has recently allowed some researchers to employ more flexible nonlinear mapping models instead; however, the question of whether nonlinear mapping models can yield meaningful scientific insights remains debated. Here, we discuss the choice of a mapping model in the context of three overarching desiderata: predictive accuracy, interpretability, and biological plausibility. We show that, contrary to popular intuition, these desiderata do not map cleanly onto the linear/nonlinear divide; instead, each desideratum can refer to multiple research goals, each of which imposes its own constraints on the mapping model. Moreover, we argue that, instead of categorically treating the mapping models as linear or nonlinear, we should instead aim to estimate the complexity of these models. We show that, in many cases, complexity provides a more accurate reflection of restrictions imposed by various research goals. Finally, we outline several complexity metrics that can be used to effectively evaluate mapping models.},

In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online.

	abstract = {Cold and warm stimuli delivered over a larger skin area tend to be more easily detected/elicit stronger sensations, a phenomenon referred to as spatial summation. The aim of the present study was to clarify how stimulation area affects thermal detection processes by evaluating whether increasing the stimulation area simply reduces the detection threshold or also reduces the uncertainty of the detection process. Psychometric functions were fitted to the detection performance of 16 healthy subjects. Stimuli (duration: 200 ms; rate of change: 300 °C/s) were delivered to the volar forearm using a Peltier-effect contact thermode and three different stimulation surfaces (23 mm2, 69 mm2, and 116 mm). Stimulation intensities were selected trial-by-trial by the psi marginal method to optimize estimation of slope and threshold parameters of the psychometric function. The raw data (100 stimulus–response pairs per subject per surface and per modality) was used to fit group-level hierarchical models of cold and warm detection, allowing to assess the effect of stimulation surface and account for inter-individual variability. Increasing stimulation area led to a compression of the psychometric function towards baseline skin temperature (reduced threshold and steeper slope), suggesting that spatial summation reflects a change in the precision of the neural representation of the stimulus which in turn influences the ability of the nervous system to distinguish true stimuli from sensory noise. Regardless of area, with the stimulation settings used in this study, cold detection appeared easier than warm detection, possibly because of structural and functional differences between cold- and warm-sensitive afferents.},

The experiments involved 4 phases: baseline naming of 4 familiar colors; training in consistently naming 4 novel shapes by using the names of the same 4 colors; naming the colors when they appeared in the form of the shapes; and naming the shapes when they appeared in color. In Exp 1, with up to 2 hr of training in shape naming, colors were named much faster than shapes. Interference was observed only in Phase 4. In Exp 2 (5 hr of training) shape naming sped up, but was still slower than color naming. There was symmetrical interference in Phases 3 and 4 that persisted 3 mo without further training. Exp 3 extended practice to 20 hr, by which time shape and color naming were equally rapid. After 20 hr, interference appeared only in Phase 3, reversing the original asymmetry. The overall pattern is inconsistent with a simple speed of processing account of interference.

Results show that fact retrieval speeded up as a power function of days of practice, but the number of daily repetitions beyond 4 produced little or no impact on RT. Interference decreased in proportion to the degree of practice but did not disappear even with 25 days of practice. Practice on specific facts and practice on the general task had multiplicative effects in reducing recognition time.

Here, we recast these beliefs as an important part of the causal machinery of interoception, and offer a novel psychophysical “heart rate discrimination“ method to estimate their accuracy and precision. By applying this task in 223 healthy participants, we demonstrate that cardiac interoceptive beliefs are more biased, less precise, and are associated with poorer metacognitive insight relative to an exteroceptive control condition.

We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Their use can be limited to simple exploratory analysis or to construct association networks for visualization but they are also basic ingredients for sophisticated multivariate data analysis methods. It is therefore important to have reliable estimates for correlation coefficients. In modern life sciences, comprehensive measurement techniques are used to measure metabolites, proteins, gene-expressions and other types of data. All these measurement techniques have errors. Whereas in the old days, with simple measurements, the errors were also simple, that is not the case anymore. Errors are heterogeneous, non-constant and not independent. This hampers the quality of the estimated correlation coefficients seriously. We will discuss the different types of errors as present in modern comprehensive life science data and show with theory, simulations and real-life data how these affect the correlation coefficients. We will briefly discuss ways to improve the estimation of such coefficients.},

The present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. First, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (orlapses). We show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function’s parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. Second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. We demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditionalX2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of Monte Carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. We have made available the software to implement our methods.},

	abstract = {Computational learning models are critical for understanding mechanisms of adaptive behavior. However, the two major current frameworks, reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian learning, both have certain limitations. For example, many Bayesian models are agnostic of inter-individual variability and involve complicated integrals, making online learning difficult. Here, we introduce a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework for individual learning under multiple forms of uncertainty (e.g., environmental volatility and perceptual uncertainty). The model assumes Gaussian random walks of states at all but the first level, with the step size determined by the next higher level. The coupling between levels is controlled by parameters that shape the influence of uncertainty on learning in a subject-specific fashion. Using variational Bayes under a mean field approximation and a novel approximation to the posterior energy function, we derive trial-by-trial update equations which (i) are analytical and extremely efficient, enabling real-time learning, (ii) have a natural interpretation in terms of RL, and (iii) contain parameters representing processes which play a key role in current theories of learning, e.g., precision-weighting of prediction error. These parameters allow for the expression of individual differences in learning and may relate to specific neuromodulatory mechanisms in the brain. Our model is very general: it can deal with both discrete and continuous states and equally accounts for deterministic and probabilistic relations between environmental events and perceptual states (i.e., situations with and without perceptual uncertainty). These properties are illustrated by simulations and analyses of empirical time series. Overall, our framework provides a novel foundation for understanding normal and pathological learning that contextualizes RL within a generic Bayesian scheme and thus connects it to principles of optimality from probability theory.},

	abstract = {In its full sense, perception rests on an agent’s model of how its sensory input comes about and the inferences it draws based on this model. These inferences are necessarily uncertain. Here, we illustrate how the hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF) offers a principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that uncertainty in perception takes. The HGF is a recent derivation of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the HGF and its account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate the extension of the HGF’s hierarchy to any number of levels; second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the HGF with decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this combination; finally, we report a simulation study that compared four optimization methods for inverting the HGF/decision model combination at different noise levels. These four methods (Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, Gaussian process-based global optimization, variational Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling) all performed well even under considerable noise, with variational Bayes offering the best combination of efficiency and informativeness of inference. Our results demonstrate that the HGF provides a principled, flexible, and efficient - but at the same time intuitive - framework for the resolution of perceptual uncertainty in behaving agents.},

An individual’s computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioural data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. To identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study using a battery of seven tasks that measure aspects of human learning, memory, perception and decision making. To examine the influence of state effects, each week, participants provided reports tracking their mood, habits and daily activities. We developed a dynamic computational phenotyping framework, which allowed us to tease apart the time-varying effects of practice and internal states such as affective valence and arousal. Our results show that many phenotype dimensions covary with practice and affective factors, indicating that what appears to be unreliability may reflect previously unmeasured structure. These results support a fundamentally dynamic understanding of cognitive variability within an individual.},

This framework has helped to relate perceptual sensitivity to the “neurometric” sensitivity of sensory-driven neural activity. However, perceptual sensitivity, as interpreted via Signal Detection Theory, is based on not just how the brain represents relevant sensory information, but also how that information is read out to form the decision variable to which the decision rule is applied. Here we discuss recent advances in our understanding of this readout process and describe its effects on the psychometric function. In particular, we show that particular aspects of the readout process can have specific, identifiable effects on the threshold, slope, upper asymptote, time dependence, and choice dependence of psychometric functions. To illustrate these points, we emphasize studies of perceptual learning that have identified changes in the readout process that can lead to changes in these aspects of the psychometric function. We also discuss methods that have been used to distinguish contributions of the sensory representation versus its readout to psychophysical performance.},

	abstract = {A key challenge in understanding mental (dys)functions is their etiological and functional heterogeneity, and several multidimensional assessments have been proposed for their comprehensive characterization. However, such assessments require lengthy testing, which may hinder reliable and efficient characterization of individual differences due to increased fatigue and distraction, especially in clinical populations. Computational modeling may address this challenge as it often provides more reliable measures of latent neurocognitive processes underlying observed behaviors and captures individual differences better than traditional assessments. However, even with a state-of-the-art hierarchical modeling approach, reliable estimation of model parameters still requires a large number of trials. Recent work suggests that Bayesian adaptive design optimization (ADO) is a promising way to address these challenges. With ADO, experimental design is optimized adaptively from trial to trial to extract the maximum amount of information about an individual’s characteristics. In this review, we first describe the ADO methodology and then summarize recent work demonstrating that ADO increases the reliability and efficiency of latent neurocognitive measures. We conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions of ADO and proposing development of ADO-based computational fingerprints to reliably and efficiently characterize the heterogeneous profiles of psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {We propose Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.},

The various standardized effect sizes can be grouped in three categories depending on the experimental design: measures of the difference between two means (the d family), measures of strength of association (e.g., r, R2, η2, ω2), and risk estimates (e.g., odds ratio, relative risk, phi; Kirk, 1996). Part I of this study reviews the d family, with a special focus on Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g for two-independent groups and two-repeated measures (or paired samples) designs. The present paper answers questions concerning the d family via Monte Carlo simulations. First, four different denominators are often proposed to standardize the mean difference in a repeated measures design. Which one should be used? Second, the literature proposes several approximations to estimate the standard error. Which one most closely estimates the true standard deviation of the distribution? Lastly, central and noncentral methods have been proposed to construct a conﬁdence interval around d. Which method leads to more precise coverage, and how to calculate it? Results suggest that the best way to standardize the effect in both designs is by using the pooled standard deviation in conjunction with a correction factor to unbias d. Likewise, the best standard error approximation is given by substituting the gamma function from the true formula by its approximation. Lastly, results from the conﬁdence interval simulations show that, under the normality assumption, the noncentral method is always superior, especially with small sample sizes. However, the central method is equivalent to the noncentral method when n is greater than 20 in each group for a between-group design and when n is greater than 24 pairs of observations for a repeated measures design. A practical guide to apply the ﬁndings of this study can be found after the general discussion.},

Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}t{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Conversely, sequential-sampling models of decision making account for both choice accuracy and response time, but assume that decisions are based on static decision values. To combine these two computational models of decision making and learning, we implemented reinforcement-learning models in which the drift diffusion model describes the choice process, thereby capturing both within- and across-trial dynamics. To exemplify the utility of this approach, we quantitatively fit data from a common reinforcement-learning paradigm using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, and compared model variants to determine whether they could capture the effects of stimulant medication in adult patients with attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD). The model with the best relative fit provided a good description of the learning process, choices, and response times. A parameter recovery experiment showed that the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach enabled accurate estimation of the model parameters. The model approach described here, using simultaneous estimation of reinforcement-learning and drift diffusion model parameters, shows promise for revealing new insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of learning and decision making, as well as the alteration of such processes in clinical groups.},

	abstract = {Computational (generative) modelling of behaviour has considerable potential for clinical applications. In order to unlock the potential of generative models, reliable statistical inference is crucial. For this, Bayesian workflow has been suggested which, however, has rarely been applied in Translational Neuromodeling and Computational Psychiatry (TN/CP) so far. Here, we present a worked example of Bayesian workflow in the context of a typical application scenario for TN/CP.
This application example uses Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) models, a family of computational models for hierarchical Bayesian belief updating. When equipped with a suitable response model, HGF models can be fit to behavioural data from cognitive tasks; these data frequently consist of binary responses and are typically univariate. This poses challenges for statistical inference due to the limited information contained in such data. We present a novel set of response models that allow for simultaneous inference from multivariate (here: two) behavioural data types. Using both simulations and empirical data from a speed-incentivised associative reward learning (SPIRL) task, we show that harnessing information from two different data streams (binary responses and continuous response times) improves the accuracy of inference (specifically, identifiability of parameters and models). Moreover, we find a linear relationship between log-transformed response times in the SPIRL task and participants’ uncertainty about the outcome.
Our analysis illustrates the benefits of Bayesian workflow for a typical use case in TN/CP. We argue that adopting Bayesian workflow for generative modelling helps increase the transparency and robustness of results, which in turn is of fundamental importance for the long-term success of TN/CP.},

The online version of this article has been corrected.] Psychology is in a replication crisis that has brought about a period of self-reflection and reform. Yet, this reform appears in many ways to focus primarily on methodological and statistical practices, with little consideration for the foundational issues that concern many theoretical and philosophical psychologists and that may provide a richer account of the crisis. In this article, we offer an overview of the history of the replication crisis, the critiques and reforms at the heart of the crisis, and several points of intersection between the reform movement and broader theoretical and philosophical issues. We argue that the problems of the replication crisis and the concerns of the reform movement in fact provide various points of entry for theoretical and philosophical psychologists to collaborate with reformers in providing a more deeply philosophical critique and reform.

Within the context of the replication crisis, open science practices like preregistration have been pivotal in facilitating greater transparency in research. However, such practices have been applied nearly exclusively to basic academic research, with rare consideration of the relevance to applied and consultancy-based research. This is particularly problematic as such research is typically reported with very low levels of transparency and accountability despite being disseminated as influential gray literature to inform practice. Evidence-based practice is best served by an appreciation of multiple sources of quality evidence, thus the current review considers the potential of preregistration to improve both the accessibility and credibility of applied research toward more rigorous evidence-based practice. The current three-part review outlines, first, the opportunities of preregistration for applied research, and second, three barriers – practical challenges, stakeholder roles, and the suitability of preregistration. Last, this review makes four recommendations to overcome these barriers and maximize the opportunities of preregistration for academics, industry, and the structures they are held within – changes to preregistration templates, new types of templates, education and training, and recognition and structural changes.},

            I consider the role of cognitive modeling in cognitive science. Modeling, and the computers that enable it, are central to the field, but the role of modeling is often misunderstood. Models are not intended to capture fully the processes they attempt to elucidate. Rather, they are explorations of ideas about the nature of cognitive processes. In these explorations, simplification is essential—through simplification, the implications of the central ideas become more transparent. This is not to say that simplification has no downsides; it does, and these are discussed. I then consider several contemporary frameworks for cognitive modeling, stressing the idea that each framework is useful in its own particular ways. Increases in computer power (by a factor of about 4 million) since 1958 have enabled new modeling paradigms to emerge, but these also depend on new ways of thinking. Will new paradigms emerge again with the next 1,000‐fold increase?},

In this paper, we show that computational techniques—even simple ones that are straightforward to use—can greatly facilitate designing, implementing, and analyzing experiments, and generally help lift research to a new level. We focus on the domain of artificial grammar learning, and we give five concrete examples in this domain for (a) formalizing and clarifying theories, (b) generating stimuli, (c) visualization, (d) model selection, and (e) exploring the hypothesis space., Zuidema et al. illustrate how empirical AGL studies can benefit from computational models and techniques. Computational models can help clarifying theories, and thus in delineating research questions, but also in facilitating experimental design, stimulus generation, and data analysis. The authors show, with a series of examples, how computational modeling can be integrated with empirical AGL approaches, and how model selection techniques can indicate the most likely model to explain experimental outcomes.},

We have implemented the Satterthwaite’s method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I–III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsigniﬁcant eﬀects – both random and ﬁxed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.},

Measures of institutional HPC investment are computed from data that is readily available from the Top 500 list, a list that has been published twice a year since 1993 that lists the fastest 500 computers in the world at that time. Institutions that are studied include US doctoral-granting institutions that fall into the very high or high research rankings according to the Carnegie Foundation classifications and additional institutions that have had entries in the Top 500 list. Research competitiveness is derived from federal funding data, compilations of scholarly publications, and institutional rankings. Correlation and Two Stage Least Square regression is used to analyze the research-related returns to investment in HPC. Two models are examined and give results that are both economically and statistically significant. Appearance on the Top 500 list is associated with a contemporaneous increase in NSF funding levels as well as a contemporaneous increase in the number of publications. The rate of depreciation in returns to HPC is rapid. The conclusion is that consistent investments in HPC at even modest levels are strongly correlated to research competitiveness.},

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression \$M\$-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models.

Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife.

We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses., Publication bias resulting from so-called "p-hacking" is pervasive throughout the life sciences; however, its effects on general conclusions made from the literature appear to be weak.},

The most common applications were two-level models where individuals were nested within contexts. Most studies were non-experimental and used nonprobability samples. The amount of data at each level varied widely across studies, as did the number of models examined. Analyses of reporting practices indicated some clear problems, with many articles not reporting enough information for a reader to critique the reported analyses. For example, in many articles, one could not determine how many models were estimated, what covariance structure was assumed, what type of centering if any was used, whether the data were consistent with assumptions, whether outliers were present, or how the models were estimated.

Traditional \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.

Bias on the part of peer reviewers and journal editors, as well as the use of outdated research practices by authors, continues to skew literature toward statistically significant effects, many of which may be false positives. To mitigate this bias, we propose a framework to enable authors to report all results efficiently (RARE), with an initial focus on experimental and other prospective empirical social science research that utilizes public study registries. This framework depicts an integrated system that leverages the capacities of existing infrastructure in the form of public registries, institutional review boards, journals, and granting agencies, as well as investigators themselves, to efficiently incentivize full reporting and thereby, improve confidence in social science findings. In addition to increasing access to the results of scientific endeavors, a well-coordinated research ecosystem can prevent scholars from wasting time investigating the same questions in ways that have not worked in the past and reduce wasted funds on the part of granting agencies.},

The simulations compared designs using the first \$\$N\_T\$\$trials from \$\$N\_P\$\$randomly selected participants, holding constant the total number of trials across all participants, \$\$N\_P {\textbackslash}! {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}! N\_T\$\$. The \$\$[N\_P,N\_T]\$\$combination maximizing the power to detect each effect depended on how the mean and variability of that effect changed with practice. For most effects, power was greater in designs having many participants with few trials each rather than the reverse, suggesting that researchers should usually try to recruit large numbers of participants for short experimental sessions. In some cases, power for a fixed total number of trials across all participants was maximized by having as few as two trials per participant in each condition. Where researchers can make plausible predictions about how their effects will change over the course of a session, they can use those predictions to increase their experimental power.},

It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate.

	abstract = {Traditionally, models in statistics are relatively simple ‘general purpose’ quantitative inference tools, while models in computational neuroscience aim more at mechanistically explaining specific observations. Research on methods for inferring behavioral and neural models from data, however, has shown that a lot could be gained by merging these approaches, augmenting computational models with distributional assumptions. This enables estimation of parameters of such models in a principled way, comes with confidence regions that quantify uncertainty in estimates, and allows for quantitative assessment of prediction quality of computational models and tests of specific hypotheses about underlying mechanisms. Thus, unlike in conventional statistics, inferences about the latent dynamical mechanisms that generated the observed data can be drawn. Future directions and challenges of this approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration. Some visual stimuli are also known to linger for longer in memory. Yet, whether these two features of visual processing are linked is unknown. Despite early assumptions that time is an extracted or higher-order feature of perception, more recent work over the past two decades has demonstrated that timing may be instantiated within sensory modality circuits. A primary location for many of these studies is the visual system, where duration-sensitive responses have been demonstrated. Furthermore, visual stimulus features have been observed to shift perceived duration. These findings suggest that visual circuits mediate or construct perceived time. Here we present evidence across a series of experiments that perceived time is affected by the image properties of scene size, clutter and memorability. More specifically, we observe that scene size and memorability dilate time, whereas clutter contracts it. Furthermore, the durations of more memorable images are also perceived more precisely. Conversely, the longer the perceived duration of an image, the more memorable it is. To explain these findings, we applied a recurrent convolutional neural network model of the ventral visual system, in which images are progressively processed over time. We find that more memorable images are processed faster, and that this increase in processing speed predicts both the lengthening and the increased precision of perceived durations. These findings provide evidence for a link between image features, time perception and memory that can be further explored with models of visual processing.},

In this paper, we performed detailed analyses of data following perceptual learning using an RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) reading task, looking beyond the change in reading speed defined by the threshold at a given accuracy on a psychometric function relating response accuracy with word exposure duration. Specifically, we explored the statistical characteristics of the response data to address two specific questions: was there a change in the slope of the psychometric function and did the improvements in performance occur consistently across different word exposure durations? Our results show that there is a general steepening of the slope of the psychometric function, leading to non-uniform improvements across stimulus levels.},

	abstract = {Condorcet (1785) proposed that a majority vote drawn from individual, independent and fallible (but not totally uninformed) opinions provides near-perfect accuracy if the number of voters is adequately large. Research in social psychology has since then repeatedly demonstrated that collectives can and do fail more often than expected by Condorcet. Since human collective decisions often follow from exchange of opinions, these failures provide an exquisite opportunity to understand human communication of metacognitive confidence. This question can be addressed by recasting collective decision-making as an information-integration problem similar to multisensory (cross-modal) perception. Previous research in systems neuroscience shows that one brain can integrate information from multiple senses nearly optimally. Inverting the question, we ask: under what conditions can two brains integrate information about one sensory modality optimally? We review recent work that has taken this approach and report discoveries about the quantitative limits of collective perceptual decision-making, and the role of the mode of communication and feedback in collective decision-making. We propose that shared metacognitive confidence conveys the strength of an individual's opinion and its reliability inseparably. We further suggest that a functional role of shared metacognition is to provide substitute signals in situations where outcome is necessary for learning but unavailable or impossible to establish.},

	abstract = {As linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) have become a widespread tool in ecology, the need to guide the use of such tools is increasingly important. One common guideline is that one needs at least five levels of the grouping variable associated with a random effect. Having so few levels makes the estimation of the variance of random effects terms (such as ecological sites, individuals, or populations) difficult, but it need not muddy one’s ability to estimate fixed effects terms—which are often of primary interest in ecology. Here, I simulate datasets and fit simple models to show that having few random effects levels does not strongly influence the parameter estimates or uncertainty around those estimates for fixed effects terms—at least in the case presented here. Instead, the coverage probability of fixed effects estimates is sample size dependent. LMMs including low-level random effects terms may come at the expense of increased singular fits, but this did not appear to influence coverage probability or RMSE, except in low sample size (N = 30) scenarios. Thus, it may be acceptable to use fewer than five levels of random effects if one is not interested in making inferences about the random effects terms (i.e. when they are ‘nuisance’ parameters used to group non-independent data), but further work is needed to explore alternative scenarios. Given the widespread accessibility of LMMs in ecology and evolution, future simulation studies and further assessments of these statistical methods are necessary to understand the consequences both of violating and of routinely following simple guidelines.},

One study concerned repetitions at one temperature, the other concerned isothermal experiments at various temperatures. Multilevel models characterize variation at various levels and handle dependencies in the data. The Weibull model was applied using Bayesian regression. The research question was how parameters varied with experimental conditions and how data can best be analyzed: no pooling (each experiment analyzed separately), complete pooling (all data analyzed together) or partial pooling (connecting the experiments while allowing for variation between experiments). In the first case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions. While variation in the initial number parameter was low (set by the researchers), the Weibull shape factor varied for each repetition from 0.58–1.44, and the rate parameter from 0.006–0.074 h. With partial pooling variation was much less, with complete pooling variation was strongly underestimated. In the second case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions per temperature experiment, level 3 of the cluster of various temperature experiments. The research question was how temperature affected the Weibull parameters. Variation in initial numbers was low (set by the researchers), the rate parameter was obviously affected by temperature, the estimate of the shape parameter depended on how the data were analyzed. With partial pooling, and one-step global modeling with a Bigelow-type model for the rate parameter, shape parameter variation was minimal. Model comparison based on prediction capacity of the various models was explored. The probability distribution of calculated decimal reduction times was much narrower using multilevel global modeling compared to the usual single level two-step approach. Multilevel modeling of microbial heat inactivation appears to be a suitable and powerful method to characterize and quantify variation at various levels. It handles possible dependencies in the data, and yields unbiased parameter estimates. The answer on the question “to pool or not to pool” depends on the goal of modeling, but if the goal is prediction, then partial pooling using multilevel modeling is the answer, provided that the experimental data allow that.},

the responses and one for the response times—that are joined at a higher level.
The submodel for the response times is based on the lognormal distribution. The
lognormal distribution is a skew distribution with a support from zero to
infinity. Such a support is unrealistic as the solution process demands a
minimal processing time that sets a response time threshold. Ignoring this
response time threshold misspecifies the model and threatens the validity of
model-based inferences. In this article, the response time model of van der
Linden is replaced by a model that is based on the three-parameter lognormal
distribution. The three-parameter lognormal distribution extends the lognormal
distribution by an additional location parameter that bounds the support away
from zero. Two different approaches to model fitting are proposed and evaluated
with regard to parameter recovery in a simulation study. The extended model is
applied to two data sets. In both data sets, the extension improves the fit of

	abstract = {Background:
Reaction time (RT) is a measure of the response to a stimulus. RT plays a very important role in our lives as its practical implications may be of great consequences. Factors that can affect the average human RT include age, sex, left or right hand, central versus peripheral vision, practice, fatigue, fasting, breathing cycle, personality types, exercise, and intelligence of the subject.

Aim:
The aim was to compare visual RTs (VRTs) and auditory RTs (ARTs) on the basis of gender and physical activity levels of medical 1st year students.

Materials and Methods:
The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 120 healthy medical students in age group of 18–20 years. RT for target stimulus that is, for the beep tone for measuring ART, and red circle for measuring VRT was determined using Inquisit 4.0 (Computer Software) in the laptop. The task was to press the spacebar as soon as the stimulus is presented. Five readings of each stimulus were taken, and their respective fastest RT's for each stimuli were recorded. Statistical analysis was done.

Results:
In both the sexes’ RT to the auditory stimulus was significantly less (P {\textless} 0.001) as compared to the visual stimulus. Significant difference was found between RT of male and female medical students (P {\textless} 0.001) as well as between sedentary and regularly exercising healthy medical 1st year students.

Conclusion:
The ART is faster than the VRT in medical students. Furthermore, male medical students have faster RTs as compared to female medical students for both auditory as well as visual stimuli. Regularly exercising medical students have faster RTs when compared with medical students with sedentary lifestyles.},

	doi = {10.1093/pm/pnaa246},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study used high-speed cooling of the skin and exact control of stimulus duration to measure the cold detection threshold in healthy participants. The objective was to compare the method of limits, in which the temperature is slowly and gradually increased/decreased until the subject perceives the stimulation, and the method of levels, in which the subject must detect brief thermal stimulations close to the threshold of perception.
METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (nine women, 11 men) aged 20-30 years participated in the study. The method of limits and method of levels were performed in all subjects in a counterbalanced order. Four cold detection thresholds were measured with the method of levels, with a temperature ramp of 300°C/sec and stimulus durations of 50 ms, 100 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms. Three thresholds were measured with the method of limits, with temperature ramps of 1°C/sec, 2°C/sec, and 4°C/sec.
RESULTS: On average, the cold detection thresholds were -0.47°C below skin temperature with the method of levels and -1.67°C the method of limits. Interindividual variability was significantly lower with the method of levels than with the method of limits.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the method of levels is more accurate than the method of limits for measuring cold detection threshold. The improvement of cold detection threshold measurement may provide new perspectives to more precisely assess the function of A-delta fibers and the spino-thalamic pathway.},

	abstract = {Researchers and clinicians are interested in estimating individual differences in the ability to process conflicting information. Conflict processing is typically assessed by comparing behavioral measures like RTs or error rates from conflict tasks. However, these measures are hard to interpret because they can be influenced by additional processes like response caution or bias. This limitation can be circumvented by employing cognitive models to decompose behavioral data into components of underlying decision processes, providing better specificity for investigating individual differences. A new class of drift-diffusion models has been developed for conflict tasks, presenting a potential tool to improve analysis of individual differences in conflict processing. However, measures from these models have not been validated for use in experiments with limited data collection. The present study assessed the validity of these models with a parameter-recovery study to determine whether and under what circumstances the models provide valid measures of cognitive processing. Three models were tested: the dual-stage two-phase model (Hübner, Steinhauser, \& Lehle, Psychological Review, 117(3), 759–784, 2010), the shrinking spotlight model (White, Ratcliff, \& Starns, Cognitive Psychology, 63(4), 210–238, 2011), and the diffusion model for conflict tasks (Ulrich, Schröter, Leuthold, \& Birngruber, Cogntive Psychology, 78, 148–174, 2015). The validity of the model parameters was assessed using different methods of fitting the data and different numbers of trials. The results show that each model has limitations in recovering valid parameters, but they can be mitigated by adding constraints to the model. Practical recommendations are provided for when and how each model can be used to analyze data and provide measures of processing in conflict tasks.},

A recent simulation study revealed that recovery performance varies largely between models and individual parameters. Moreover, recovery was generally not very impressive. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to introduce and test an improved fit procedure. It is based on a grid search for determining the initial parameter values and on a specific criterion for assessing the goodness of fit.

	abstract = {Data in the natural sciences are often in the form of percentages or proportions that are continuous and bounded by 0 and 1. Statistical analysis assuming a normal error structure can produce biased and incorrect estimates when data are doubly bounded. Beta regression uses an error structure appropriate for such data. We conducted a literature review of percent and proportion data from 2004 to 2020 to determine the types of analyses used for (0, 1) bounded data. Our literature review showed that before 2012, angular transformations accounted for 93\% of analyses of proportion or percent data. After 2012, angular transformation accounted for 52\% of analyses and beta regression accounted for 14\% of analyses. We compared a linear model with angular transformation with beta regression using data from two fields of the natural sciences that produce continuous, bounded data: biogeochemistry and ecological elemental composition. We found little difference in model diagnostics, likelihood ratios, and p-values between the two models. However, we found substantially different coefficient estimates from the back-calculated beta regression and angular transformation models. Beta regression provides reliable parameter estimates in natural science studies where effect sizes are considered as important as hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {Since the 18th century, the p value has been an important part of hypothesis-based scientific investigation. As statistical and data science engines accelerate, questions emerge: to what extent are scientific discoveries based on p values reliable and reproducible? Should one adjust the significance level or find alternatives for the p value? Inspired by these questions and everlasting attempts to address them, here, we provide a systematic examination of the p value from its roles and merits to its misuses and misinterpretations. For the latter, we summarize modest recommendations to handle them. In parallel, we present the Bayesian alternatives for seeking evidence and discuss the pooling of p values from multiple studies and datasets. Overall, we argue that the p value and hypothesis testing form a useful probabilistic decision-making mechanism, facilitating causal inference, feature selection, and predictive modeling, but that the interpretation of the p value must be contextual, considering the scientific question, experimental design, and statistical principles., The discussions of hypothesis testing and the p value are enduring. They are, however, done in relative isolation; theorists inspect them using mathematical arguments, and applied scientists scrutinize them via experimental intuition. Most are aware that the interpretation of the p value needs to be contextual, but what does “contextual” mean? Here, linking examples and equations, we present a relatively comprehensive inquiry into the foundations, merits, and challenges of hypothesis testing and the p value: why they are useful and when negligence may occur. We build presentations from relatively simple history, philosophy, and cases to slightly complex statistical reasoning. We endeavor to make our language accessible and stories complementary to a broad audience; some apply those instruments frequently, some aspire to develop new methods, and perhaps all hope to one day find a cogent way to translate patterns from data into knowledge., In this review, the authors discuss the roles, challenges, and merits of the p value in hypothesis-based scientific inquiry and emphasize why the interpretation of the p value needs to be contextual. They then present arguments from causal inference, feature selection, and predictive modeling. The authors explore common misuses and misinterpretations and potential remedies and examine Bayesian alternatives, meta-analysis methods for combining several p values, and multiple comparison techniques. Real-world examples and detailed statistical arguments for audiences with different backgrounds are provided.},

We conducted a review of meta-analyses of studies investigating the association of biological, environmental or cognitive parameters with neurological, psychiatric and somatic diseases, excluding treatment studies, in order to estimate the average statistical power across these domains. Taking the effect size indicated by a meta-analysis as the best estimate of the likely true effect size, and assuming a threshold for declaring statistical significance of 5\%, we found that approximately 50\% of studies have statistical power in the 0–10\% or 11–20\% range, well below the minimum of 80\% that is often considered conventional. Studies with low statistical power appear to be common in the biomedical sciences, at least in the specific subject areas captured by our search strategy. However, we also observe evidence that this depends in part on research methodology, with candidate gene studies showing very low average power and studies using cognitive/behavioural measures showing high average power. This warrants further investigation.},

Firstly, statistical modeling equips healthcare professionals with advanced tools for analyzing complex healthcare datasets, improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning by revealing hidden insights. Secondly, it supports evidence-based decision-making by quantifying treatment effectiveness, assessing risks, and evaluating interventions. By relying on empirical evidence rather than intuition, healthcare providers can make informed decisions that optimize patient outcomes. Additionally, it empowers early identification of high-risk patients, personalizes interventions, optimizes resource allocation, and enhances healthcare efficiency. Lastly, statistical modeling aids in quality improvement by identifying areas for enhancement and monitoring performance indicators. Overall, statistical modeling transforms healthcare, enhancing patient care, resource allocation, and decision-making, paving the way for a data-driven future in medicine.},

	abstract = {It has been reported in the academic literature that higher education students, particularly from disciplines that do not focus on mathematics, deal with adverse emotions when faced with problems related to statistics (Feinberg \& Halperin, 1978). This phenomenon can impair the learning process and has been linked to negative academic outcomes (Onwuegbuzie \& Daley, 1999). It has been suggested that providing students with additional support material may be a valuable alternative in this context (Martyn Chamberlain et al., 2014). Flowcharts are a type of graphic organizers that seek to show the sequence of steps to be followed within a process (Grosskinsky et al., 2019), basically, they help to represent algorithms in a graphical way. 
The present work proposes a flowchart based on scientific evidence that serves as a guide for the student, in order to allow him to make better decisions when choosing the appropriate statistical test according to his research objectives. Particularly, it focuses on tests of inferential statistics, such as those that fall into the categories of normality, associations, correlations, differences and experimental. As in other studies focused on the realization of a flow diagram (Edward \& Rosli, 2021; Toledo-Chávarri et al., 2020; Yanco et al., 2019), the methodology of this paper was the summarized realization of different theoretical proposals where the recommended proposals to recognize the proposed research hypotheses are made known. In conclusion, this paper presents a summary of scientific evidence where researchers, new or not, can make decisions when choosing inferential tests, especially in the social sciences.},
